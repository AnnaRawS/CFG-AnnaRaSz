    <h2>Mindfulness</h2>
    <p> If exercise were a pill, it would be the most-sought after prescription in the world. It is undisputed that exercise has a positive effect on the body, both physically and mentally. Exercise releases feel-good endorphins which can enhance your sense of well-being. Long term, the benefits of regular exercise can also lead to an increase in confidence, be more sociable, and cope with life's stressors in a more confident way. </p>
    <p> Boxing in particular can have such a positive impact on mental health. Focusing so intensely on one exercise makes it difficult to think about anything else going on in your life, which can happen when performing other activities such as running or cycling. The physical act of punching acts as a release, which helps us to feel more centered in our bodies and minds. </p>
    <p> Join us at Box 'n Mind to see what all the hype is about! </p>
