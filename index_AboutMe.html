    <h2>Who's your teacher?</h2>

    <p>Hi, I’m Jacqui – thank you for visiting my site! Read on if you want to know a little more about me and why I run these classes. [Picture of Jacqui]</p>

    <p>I’m fun, energetic, empathetic and an avid advocate for exercise-based mindfulness.</p>

    <p>I’ve always had a passion for sport and exercise, having played team sports throughout my childhood and progressing to play lacrosse at international level representing Wales. Growing up, this was a real release for me.</p>

    <p>I studied Psychology at university and upon graduating found myself in the unsettling situation I’m sure many other graduates have also found themselves in – not really knowing what to do next! I spent a year in marketing before realising my true passion and priority in life lay in helping those in need psychologically, and have gone on to pursue this as a career.</p>

    <p>Currently, I’m working for the Adult Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) programme for the NHS, treating adults with common mental health problems including depression, anxiety, panic and phobias. You can read more about the programme <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/mental-health/adults/iapt/" class="externallink"> here</a>. In my day to day, I deliver low intensity Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) based interventions including behavioural activation, worry management and exposure therapy.</p>

    <p>Although I’m pretty busy (!) this hasn’t taken away from my passion for sport - I make it a priority personally to practice yoga and mindfulness weekly. Adding boxing into the mix creates a perfect balance of calm and release.</p>

    <p>I’ve been boxing for four years now and have been running the Box ‘n Mind sessions at Miguel’s Boxing Studio since June 2017.</p>

    <p>If you’ve found yourself struggling with your mental wellbeing – or even if you just fancy getting in shape in a safe space – please come along and get involved!</p>

    <p>Jacqui</p>

<p></p>
<p>P.S. My professional qualifications are as follows:</p>

    <li>BSc in Psychology from Durham University</li>
    <li>Masters in Mental Health Studies from Kings College London</li>
    <li>Certificate in low intensity CBT from UCL</li>
    <li>Completion of a Mindfulness Course at The Now Project</li>
